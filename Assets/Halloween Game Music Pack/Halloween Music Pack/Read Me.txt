Thank you for buying this music pack and supporting my brand. This pack is inspired by the month of October's halloween.

The tracks in this pack are duplicated for the purpose of having a loopable track and a one-time playthrough version to give you the flexibility you desire for your games.

Feel free to use this in whatever way you would like. You do not need to credit me but I would highly appreciate it. I would love to know when & how you use this music so that I can share your game with my audience.

I hope these tracks serve you well in your RPG, Platformer, Metroidvania and any ACTION-PACKED games!


Feel free to contact me for custom music or if you have any questions at:
